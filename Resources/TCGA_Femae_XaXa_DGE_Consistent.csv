Additionally, mutations in RFC1 have been identified in patients with ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder, a rare neurodegenerative disorder that shares some features with ataxia telangiectasia.

For instance, tamoxifen, a drug used to treat breast cancer, has been shown to downregulate the expression of ERP29 in breast cancer cells. Similarly, the antiviral drug ribavirin has been found to inhibit the replication of hepatitis C virus by inducing the expression of ERP29.

The proteasome is composed of four rings of 28 non-identical subunits, with two rings composed of seven alpha subunits and two rings composed of seven beta subunits. PSMB6 is distributed throughout eukaryotic cells and is involved in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process. Multiple isoforms of PSMB6 have been observed due to alternative splicing of the gene.","PSMB6 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. In cancer, PSMB6 has been found to be overexpressed in multiple types of tumors, including breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Targeting PSMB6 with proteasome inhibitors has shown promise in the treatment of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor that targets PSMB6, was approved by the FDA in 2003 for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Other proteasome inhibitors, such as carfilzomib and ixazomib, have also been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In addition, PSMB6 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

Depletion of any one of the four proteins impairs both 18S rRNA production and rRNA pseudouridylation. Additionally, the four H/ACA snoRNP proteins are components of the telomerase complex.

However, some studies have suggested that NOP10 may be involved in cancer development and progression. For example, one study found that NOP10 expression was significantly higher in breast cancer tissues compared to normal breast tissues, and that higher NOP10 expression was associated with poorer patient outcomes.

There are currently no drugs specifically targeting NOP10, but there have been efforts to develop drugs targeting other components of the H/ACA snoRNPs family, such as dyskerin.

Mutations in NFKBIE have been associated with various diseases, including lymphoma, leukemia, and autoimmune disorders.","Mutations in NFKBIE have been linked to various diseases, including lymphoma, leukemia, and autoimmune disorders. In lymphoma and leukemia, NFKBIE mutations have been found to contribute to the development and progression of the disease by promoting cell survival and proliferation. In autoimmune disorders, NFKBIE mutations have been associated with dysregulation of the immune system and increased inflammation.

Targeted drug discovery efforts have focused on developing inhibitors of NF-kappa-B activation by targeting NFKBIE. One example is the drug bortezomib, which is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Bortezomib inhibits the proteasome, a cellular complex that degrades proteins, including NFKBIE.

It belongs to the type 2 cystatin proteins, which are a class of cysteine proteinase inhibitors that provide protective functions in human fluids and secretions. The cystatin locus on chromosome 20 contains the majority of the type 2 cystatin genes and pseudogenes. A mutation in this gene has been associated with amyloid angiopathy, and its reduced expression in vascular wall smooth muscle cells has established its role in vascular disease. Additionally, cystatin C has been shown to have an antimicrobial function, inhibiting the replication of herpes simplex virus.","Mutations in the CST3 gene have been associated with several diseases, including hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, age-related macular degeneration, and Alzheimer's disease. In particular, the A25T mutation in CST3 has been linked to cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a condition characterized by the accumulation of amyloid protein in the walls of blood vessels in the brain, leading to hemorrhagic stroke. 

Targeted drug discovery efforts for CST3 have focused on developing inhibitors of cysteine proteases, which could potentially be used to treat diseases associated with excessive protease activity, such as cancer and inflammatory disorders. Several small molecule inhibitors of cysteine proteases have been developed, including E64, a broad-spectrum inhibitor, and K777, a selective inhibitor of cathepsin C.

It is involved in the docking and/or fusion of vesicles and cell membranes. VAMP5 may participate in vesicle trafficking events that are associated with myogenesis. Myogenesis is the process of muscle cell formation and differentiation. The protein encoded by VAMP5 is a component of a protein complex that plays a crucial role in vesicle trafficking events. This gene is important for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle cell formation and differentiation.,"There is limited information available on the disease implications of VAMP5. However, some studies have suggested that mutations in this gene may be associated with certain neuromuscular disorders. Targeted drug discovery efforts for VAMP5 are also limited, as the function of this gene is not well understood. Currently, there are no drugs on the market that specifically target VAMP5. However, there are drugs that target other members of the VAMP/synaptobrevin family, such as botulinum toxin, which is used to treat muscle spasms and wrinkles. Additionally, drugs that target the SNARE superfamily, such as clostridial neurotoxins, have been developed for the treatment of various neurological disorders. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential disease implications of VAMP5 and to develop targeted therapies for related disorders.",GO:0043001 Golgi to plasma membrane protein transport;GO:0061951 establishment of protein localization to plasma membrane;GO:0006893 Golgi to plasma membrane transport,,,Nucleoplasm;Plasma membrane (Approved),,,(M5913)HALLMARK INTERFERON GAMMA RESPONSE

This gene is involved in the metabolism of lipids and is regulated by retinoids, which are used in the treatment of hyperproliferative dermatological diseases. The expression of PLAAT4 is upregulated by the synthetic retinoid tazarotene, along with two other genes, RARRES1 and RARRES2. RARRES3, another gene regulated by retinoids, is thought to act as a tumor suppressor or growth regulator. The function of PLAAT4 in lipid metabolism and its regulation by retinoids suggest that it may play a role in skin health and disease.","There is limited information available on the disease implications of PLAAT4. However, its involvement in lipid metabolism and regulation by retinoids suggest that it may play a role in skin health and disease. Targeted drug discovery efforts for PLAAT4 are also limited, but its regulation by retinoids has led to the development of tazarotene, a synthetic retinoid used in the treatment of hyperproliferative dermatological diseases such as psoriasis and acne. Tazarotene works by binding to retinoic acid receptors (RARs), including RAR?, which regulates the expression of PLAAT4 and other genes involved in skin health. Other successful drugs on the market that target RARs include isotretinoin, used in the treatment of severe acne, and bexarotene, used in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.",GO:0150073 regulation of protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase activity;GO:0150074 positive regulation of protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase activity;GO:0070292 N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine metabolic process,,ENZYME proteins:Hydrolases; Enzymes; Predicted intracellular proteins,,,,
