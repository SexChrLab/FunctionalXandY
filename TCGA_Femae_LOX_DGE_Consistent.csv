This enzyme plays a crucial role in preventing mutations that can lead to cancer or neurodegeneration by hydrolyzing oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates, such as 8-oxo-dGTP, 8-oxo-dATP, 2-hydroxy-dATP, and 2-hydroxy rATP, to monophosphates. The gene is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, with some in the mitochondria, suggesting that it is involved in the sanitization of nucleotide pools for both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. There are several alternatively spliced transcript variants of the gene, some of which encode distinct isoforms, and a rare single-nucleotide polymorphism that results in the production of an additional, longer isoform (p26) has been described.","NUDT1 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and inflammation. In cancer, NUDT1 has been shown to be downregulated in several types of tumors, including breast, lung, and colon cancer, suggesting that it may act as a tumor suppressor. In neurodegeneration, mutations in NUDT1 have been linked to the development of Parkinson's disease, and the enzyme has been shown to protect against oxidative stress-induced neuronal death. In inflammation, NUDT1 has been shown to regulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that it may be a potential target for anti-inflammatory therapies.

Several drug discovery efforts have targeted NUDT1, with the aim of developing drugs that can modulate its activity for therapeutic purposes. One approach has been to identify small molecules that can activate NUDT1, with the goal of enhancing its protective effects against oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Another approach has been to develop inhibitors of NUDT1, with the aim of reducing its activity in cancer cells and promoting their death. However, no drugs targeting NUDT1 have yet been approved for clinical use.

One example of a successful drug that indirectly targets NUDT1 is the chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which is commonly used to treat colon, breast, and other cancers. 5-FU is converted into an active metabolite that can be incorporated into DNA, leading to the formation of DNA adducts that are recognized and excised by NUDT1. Inhibition of NUDT1 by 5-FU leads to the accumulation of DNA damage and cell death in cancer cells.",GO:0042262 DNA protection;GO:0006152 purine nucleoside catabolic process;GO:0009164 nucleoside catabolic process,,ENZYME proteins:Hydrolases; Enzymes; Predicted intracellular proteins; Cancer-related genes:Candidate cancer biomarkers,Cytosol (Supported),,,
